=head1 NAME

Kabelsalat - Will help you getting structure information from several E-CAD list exports and
combine them to a base for worker assistance systems.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<Kabelsalat> F<[options]>

 Options:
   --help                  Shows a brief help message
   --man                   Prints the full documentation
   --loglevel=[VALUE]      Defines the level for messages
   --wiring=[FILE]         Specifies the input file containing the wiring list
   --devices=[FILE]        Specifies the CSV data source for device article mapping

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Prints a brief help message containing the synopsis and a few more
information about usage and exists.

=item B<--man>

Prints the complete manual page and exits.

=item B<--loglevel>=I<[VALUE]>

To adjust the level for the logging messages the desired level may be defined
with this option. Valid values are:

=over 4

=item I<FATAL>

One or more key business functionalities are not working and the whole system does not fulfill
the business functionalities.

=item I<ERROR>

One or more functionalities are not working, preventing some functionalities from working correctly.

=item I<WARN>

Unexpected behavior happened inside the application, but it is continuing its work and the key
business features are operating as expected.

=item I<INFO>

An event happened, the event is purely informative and can be ignored during normal operations.

=item I<DEBUG>

A log level used for events considered to be useful during software debugging when more granular
information is needed.

=item I<TRACE>

A log level describing events showing step by step execution of your code that can be ignored
during the standard operation, but may be useful during extended debugging sessions.

=back

=item B<--wiring>=I<[FILE]>

Specifies the input file containing the wiring list as CSV data source.

B<Example:>
C<=010+INT-E6:PE;=010+INT-X:PE;=010-0100W6;GNYE;1,5 mmÂ²;3 m;>

=item B<--devices>=I<[FILE]>

Specifies the CSV data source for device article mapping. The file is formatted
as: [DEVICE IDENTIFIER];[COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF ARTICLES];[MAIN ARTICLE]

B<Example:>
C<=010+INT-F1;PXC.0800886,PXC.1004348;PXC.0800886>

The main article in the third column is used to specify an article which is used as
a kind of main part for the device. For example a relay and additional contacts. In
this case the main article is the relay and the articles containing additional contacts
as extension to the basic relay is only listed in the second column as article.
